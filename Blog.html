        <p style="text-align:center">My name is Tucker Parent, and I am 19 years old. I live in Cumberland Maine, but am originally from Beverly Massachusetts. I have a 22 year old sister that is a Umaine Alumni, and my parents are Peter, and Yvonne Parent.
        The top left picture is my dad, my siter and her friend, my mom, and I in Georgia this past summer. My dad and I also visted New York City
        at the end of summer, the picture in the top middle row is my dad and I on the Brooklyn Bridge. Next to that is my family at my cousins wedding this sumner
        on Peaks island. Some of my favorite things to do are play sports. The bottom left is a picture of me in a highschool lacrosse game. I also played hockey, football, and soccer in high school.
            I also love to ski and hike. On top of a mountain is where I love to be!
