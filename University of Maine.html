<p style="font-size:150%;">I am a Business Marketing major at The University of Maine in my second year. I started out my freshman year majoring in civil engineering
but decided that business was a better fit for me. One of the many things I love about Umaine is how helpful my advisors were, they
made my transition between major very easy and kept me on the right track with my classes. I am from Maine so my transition into college
wasnt very difficult, but all the students and staff here are friendly and make you feel at home. </p>
